Lyrics:
-------------------------------------------------
Verse 1
Her eyes are stars that never fade,
A gentle light my soul has craved.
Her laughter lingers in the air,
A fleeting warmth that feels so rare.
Every step, the world turns still,
She moves like rivers, soft and real.

Chorus (Hook – “Dream”)
Dream… she’s the whisper in my night,
A shadow dancing in the light.
Dream… though she’s slipping through my hands,
I reach for her, but time won’t bend.
She’s a dream I can’t let go,
The only truth my heart still knows.

Verse 2
Once I held her close, the night was ours,
We painted skies with fleeting stars.
But morning came and stole her name,
The world was real, but not the same.
Now I walk these empty streets,
Where echoes of her voice still meet.

Chorus (Hook – “Dream”)
Dream… she’s the whisper in my night,
A shadow dancing in the light.
Dream… though she’s slipping through my hands,
I reach for her, but time won’t bend.
She’s a dream I can’t let go,
The only truth my heart still knows.

Bridge
If only dreams could bring her near,
Erase the silence, kill the fear.
But when I wake, she disappears,
A ghost of love I hold sincere.

Chorus (Reprise)
Dream… she’s the whisper in my night,
A shadow dancing in the light.
Dream… though she’s gone, she lives in me,
Forever lost, yet meant to be.
She’s a dream I can’t let go,
The only truth my heart still knows.
